## Instructions

**This is the awesome card flipping game.**

To play the game you need to **pair cards** that have the same symbol on them.
Click on any card to flip it and see the symbol it has on it.
If you flip two cards with the same symbol they will be solved and you can move to the cards remaining.
This is a *memory game* so you will need to remember the cards as you flip them because you can only see two cards at a time.

**Have FUN!**
